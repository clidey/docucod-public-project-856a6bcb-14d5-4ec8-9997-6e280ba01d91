## Resetting or Reinstalling DietPi

When your DietPi device experiences persistent issues that cannot be resolved through configuration or software adjustments, a clean reset or reinstall may be necessary. This process ensures a fresh start by clearing system modifications, restoring default settings, or reinstalling the entire operating system image while protecting your valuable data through prudent backups.

DietPi’s design facilitates both soft resets—returning the system to a default state without wiping the entire system—and full reinstallation for complete refreshment. Understanding these distinctions and following best practices will help you maintain system integrity and minimize data loss.

## Preparing for Reset or Reinstall

Before proceeding with a reset or reinstall, it is critical to safeguard your user data and system configurations. DietPi offers comprehensive backup tools that you should use to create a restore point of your current system state. This includes all personal files, installed software configurations, and database contents.

Locations such as `/mnt/dietpi_userdata` commonly hold persistent user data, which should be preserved independently of system resets. Using the `dietpi-backup` tool, you can make full system backups to an external drive or network location, assuring you have a safety net should the reset require a restoration.

Additionally, confirm that:
- The system is plugged into a reliable power source.
- You have a secondary device ready for assistance or to access the DietPi forums in case of unforeseen difficulties.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Backup">
Run `dietpi-backup` from the terminal or menu to save your current system state to a supported backup location. Follow the interactive prompts to verify or adjust the backup target.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Backup">
After completion, review the backup logs accessible from within `dietpi-backup` to confirm success.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Backing up before resetting or reinstalling is essential to prevent loss of your user data and installed software configurations.
</Tip>

## Soft Reset: Resetting DietPi to Defaults

A soft reset restores DietPi to its default configuration without requiring a full system reinstall. This process resets critical system configurations, clears logs, and removes installed software selectively while retaining the core OS and user data.

Use this approach if your system is operational but misconfigured or unstable.

To perform a soft reset:

- Run the `dietpi-cleaner` utility.
- Select options relevant to clearing install states, logs, and unneeded files.
- Confirm removal of installed software as prompted.

This process allows you to start fresh while keeping your data intact.

<Steps>
<Step title="Launch dietpi-cleaner">
Execute `dietpi-cleaner` from the terminal or DietPi menu, and navigate through the cleaner categories to disable or clean as needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Cleaners">
Enable options such as 'Logs', 'APT cache', and 'Files' to start a comprehensive cleanup.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Cleaning Process">
Confirm and run the cleaning operation to reset system states and clear residual data.
</Step>
<Step title="Reboot the System">
After completion, reboot your device with `reboot` to apply changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Soft resets do NOT reinstall the Linux OS image. Use full reinstall if you want to start anew completely.
</Note>

## Full Reinstallation: Starting Fresh

Sometimes, system issues stem from corrupted core files or persistent configuration errors that require a complete reinstallation of the DietPi operating system. This process involves flashing a new DietPi image onto your device’s storage media.

Before reinstalling, ensure you have:

1. Backed up all important data using `dietpi-backup` or manually copied from `/mnt/dietpi_userdata`.
2. The correct latest DietPi image downloaded for your hardware.

To reinstall DietPi:

<Steps>
<Step title="Download Latest Image">
Go to the official DietPi website and download the appropriate image for your hardware platform.
</Step>
<Step title="Flash the Image">
Use an image flashing tool such as Raspberry Pi Imager or balenaEtcher to write the image to your SD card or eMMC device. Follow platform-specific instructions carefully.
</Step>
<Step title="First Boot Setup">
Insert the flashed media into your device and power it on. Follow the first boot prompts for initial configuration, including network setup, user accounts, and optional software installation.
</Step>
<Step title="Restore Data">
After reinstall, use `dietpi-backup` to restore your previously saved system state and user data, or manually move data from external backups.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Ensure to verify that the latest image matches your device model to avoid compatibility issues.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Persistent Reset or Reinstall Failures

If resetting or reinstalling fails, or the system repeatedly enters boot issues, consider the following checks:

- **Power Supply**: Inadequate power can cause SD card corruption or boot failures.
- **Storage Media**: Faulty or aging SD cards or eMMC modules may need replacement.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Confirm your device is officially supported.
- **Backup Integrity**: Corrupted backups can cause failures on restore.

Useful commands and checks include verifying mount points, filesystem integrity, and network connectivity using built-in DietPi utilities such as `dietpi-drive_manager` and `dietpi-update`.

For more detailed solutions, consult the [Troubleshooting Boot and Network Problems](/getting_started/troubleshooting_faq/boot_network_issues) guide.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Power and Storage Media">
Test your power supply and replace your SD card or eMMC if uncertain.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Backup Location and Contents">
Mount your backup location and ensure backup files are complete and accessible.
</Step>
<Step title="Use dietpi-drive_manager">
Run `dietpi-drive_manager` to verify and repair mount points and filesystem permissions if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Retry Reinstallation or Restore">
Attempt the reinstall or restore, reviewing error messages and logs for clues.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Persistent failures often relate to hardware or power issues rather than software. Ensure your device and media are sound before deep troubleshooting.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Backup and Restore

- Always create a backup before performing any reset or reinstall.
- Store backups on external USB drives, network shares, or cloud storage that support symlinks and Unix permissions (e.g., ext4, NFS with full permissions).
- Use the `dietpi-backup` tool for consistent and verified backups; it automates exclude/include filtering and filesystem integrity checks.
- After restoring, verify system functionality before changing critical configurations.

Backing up and restoring through DietPi’s utilities minimizes risks and ensures you can recover from mistakes or unexpected failures.
