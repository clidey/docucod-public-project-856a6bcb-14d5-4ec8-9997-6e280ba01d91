## Finding Help and Exploring Next Steps with DietPi

Once you have your DietPi system up and running, you might find yourself looking for additional resources, official support, or guidance on how to get the most out of your setup. This page connects you to the essential places where you can seek assistance, learn advanced usage, and join the DietPi community.

### Official Documentation and Guidance

DietPi offers a rich set of online documentation that covers every aspect of the system, from installation through advanced configuration. Whether you are troubleshooting, adding software, or optimizing your system, these resources are invaluable. Visit [DietPi Documentation](https://dietpi.com/docs/) to explore comprehensive guides and how-tos.

From the documentation, you can access detailed walkthroughs on software installation, system configuration with `dietpi-config`, updating procedures using `dietpi-update`, and much more. These resources are continually updated to reflect the latest features and best practices.

### Community and Support Channels

Engaging with the DietPi community is a great way to get answers, share your experiences, and learn from others. The [DietPi Forum](https://dietpi.com/forum/) is the official community hub where users and developers discuss issues, suggest improvements, and help newcomers.

For reporting bugs or contributing to the project, the official GitHub repository at [https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi) is the place to go. Here, you can open issues, track feature requests, and even contribute code or documentation.

### Effective Use of DietPi Utilities

DietPi includes several powerful command-line tools designed to streamline system management. Tools like `dietpi-software` for installing and managing optimized applications, `dietpi-backup` for system backups and restores, and `dietpi-services` for controlling running services, are all accessible from the terminal.
